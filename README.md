# Discord Dungeon Master
This project is developed as my final project for CS50 2022. Discord Dungeon
Master is a Discord bot that aims to bring some of the fun of playing DnD with
your friends to a discord server. This is not intended to accurately recreate
every element of DnD, but rather adapt some of the mechanics to allow for a
casual and social activity that can be done asynchronously by the users.

Users create a character with stats, equipment, traits, spells, etc. Then
they can pursue activities and quests via their own characters, either alone or
with the cooperation of other users. They level up over time and accrue items.
When creating a character they will establish a long-term goal, and when that
goal is satisfied, they will have the option to "retire" that character which
will store info about the character and a summary of their adventures. This
will act as a sort of social leaderboard.

The majority of interaction is via bot commands in chat, and as such the
intended use is within a seperate text channel meant specifically for the
Discord Dungeon Master and user characters.
